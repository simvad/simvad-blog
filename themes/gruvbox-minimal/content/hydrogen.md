title: "Green Hydrogen: The Economic Case For Being Less Efficient"
draft: false

Multiple EU countries are currently making large investments in the production of green hydrogen. The argument often seems to consist of one or both of the following points[^1].
- The transition away from fossil fuels is necessary, not only in energy systems (where we may be able to rely on renewables) but also in steel, fertilizer and other industries, where hydrocarbons seem to be an inexorable part of the chain.
- Renewable energy sources are intermittent, meaning that hydrogen can be used to seasonally stabilize grid load.

To a relative amateur such as myself, these seem like solid arguments, which makes it all the more puzzling to me that most seem to go about it in a deeply counterintuitive way. At least if you take a look at the numbers.

### Why more efficiency will hardly deliver €2/kg hydrogen

The name of the game for these firms seems to be efficiency. How can we use fancy techniques and prescious metals in our electrolyzers to squeeze out just a bit more hydrogen for the same amount of power?

Nature sets a ceiling for this efficiency - water electrolysis requires about 39 kWh per kg of hydrogen. A modern electrolyzer like the [HyProvide X-1200](https://www.greenhydrogensystems.com/electrolysers/hyprovide-x-series-6mw-modular-electrolyser) ends up actually using 51.9 kWh/kg, implying an efficiency of around 75%[^2]. I would argue that we would be much better off focusing on creating less efficient ways of producing hydrogen.

To make green hydrogen economically viable, the magic number everyone talks seems to be [around €2/kg](https://energiwatch.dk/Energinyt/Politik___Markeder/article17064156.ece). This isn't arbitrary - it's roughly the threshold where hydrogen starts to compete with fossil alternatives in many applications.

With current industrial electricity prices in Denmark (€0.10-€0.15/kWh), even a perfectly efficient system would produce hydrogen at €3.90-5.85/kg from electricity costs alone[^3]. No amount of engineering wizardry can overcome this basic economic reality. The only path to €2/kg hydrogen requires electricity around €0.05/kWh or less[^4]. At current margins and relevant timeframes, this seems rather unrealistic.

### A game of derivative
Luckily, the cost of hydrogen from an electrolyzer isn't only determined by the price of power, meaning that the price of industrial power isn't the only relevant derivative. In reality (although still put very simply) the cost of hydro




[^1]: There may be a third argument about fuel for cars and planes. I think this is a largely moot point, although why this is deserves its own article at some point. Luckily, I think this is argely divorced from the larger point of this article. If you disagree, you should feel very welcome to write me an angry email.
