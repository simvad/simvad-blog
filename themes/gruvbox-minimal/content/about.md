My name is Simon Vadsholt, a recent graduate in Computer Science & Economics. Below are some of my interests and ongoing projects, all of which will hopefully be covered more fully on here at some point. If you're in a postion to hire people to do cool things, take a look at my [CV](/cv.pdf)

## Projects

### TabletopTunes
[TabletopTunes](github.com/simvad/TabletopTunes) came to be because I got tired of juggling too many Youtube playlists of ambient mood music while running TTRPGs. The desktop-app instead provides you with a simple tagging and querying system that lets you maintain the same vast catalogue of tracks while dynamically adjusting the queue on the fly, based on tag-based queries.

### Darwin Games Platform
The [Darwin Games Platform](https://github.com/simvad/DarwinGame) is an online platform with simple invitation structure to make setting up a tournament of the [Darwin Game](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GcZCMu7ZYHpJCh5bx/p/CnDsQAdzmDMF2LrY7) as simple as possible.

## Interests
- Effective Altruism and Progress Studies ([How do we boost the growth of poor countries?](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/12434140-once-you-start-thinking-about-growth-it-s-hard-to-think))
- Linux (How much can I mess around with my operating system, before using my PC becomes more frustrating than it's fun)
