The web was built for serendipity. Yet as the digital garden has become a shopping mall, those delightful moments of stumbling upon exactly what you needed (or didn't know you needed) are fading. Here, I've gathered a few search engines that still enable digital serendipity."


# Marginalia
[search.marginalia.nu/](https://search.marginalia.nu/) is probably the entry on this list closest to a standard search engine, the big difference being the exclusion of commercial sites. This leads to search results consisting of passion rather than profit motive. This is not necessarily better or worse than e.g. Google, but the amount of passion projects a search with Marginalia turns up makes it worth it to make it part of your searching habits.  

# Wiby
[wiby.me/](https://wiby.me/) is a similar concept to Marginalia described above. However, the amount of indexed sites seems to be lower, making it less ideal for strictly utilitarian queries. Instead, it functions wonderfully as a window into the early days of the internet. I especially enjoy querying it with things I love and seeing it return unexpected but assuredly related sites. Previous delightful queries include "Jorge Luis Borges", "Effcetive ALtruism" and "infrastructure". The "surprise me" button can also provide a fascinating evening all by itself.

# Exa
[exa.ai](https://exa.ai/search) is a relatively new but very well functioning semantic search engine. I have found it especailly useful as a way of recovering articles I remember reading but can't find by describing them in great detail. For similar reasons, it works well for finding writing in specific styles or describing specific feelings. Finally, there is a special delight in providing it with some of your favorite writing and letting the embeddings find similar stuff.
